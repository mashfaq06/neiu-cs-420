# BlueFriday

## Objective
The objective of this project is to find what days are the best to offer promotions. Promotions and sales are the best way to attract customers. Customers usually shop when there are holidays. Therefore, the best time to attract customers is to have promotions around holidays. This project will inform us about the holidays and when is the best time to keep the promotions. This application will answer the following questions:  
1.	Which country had the most holidays in 2019?
2.	Which month had the most holidays in 2019?
3.	How many long weekends occurred during 2019?

The API I will be using for this project is from **https://holidayapi.com/**.

## Motivation 
One of the motivations is personal interest, along with having a family background in business.  The main goal of any business is to increase sales and customer loyalty. As a result, it proves to be a very challenging process since competition is very high, and other businesses are ready to go to any heights to increase their sales. Therefore, it is very crucial to place essential business tactics to attract customers. One of the ways is to give out promotions and offer discounts. However, when to offer these sales is a crucial component to be considered. Since many people go out for shopping is during the holidays. Knowing the important holidays will allow businesses to place promotions to attract customers and increase their customer loyalty.
